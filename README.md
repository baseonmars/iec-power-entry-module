# Universal IEC Power Inlet with Voltage Surge and Current Inrush Limiting

I find myself needing a power entry solution when working on amps and other audio related equipment with linear power supplies.

This is my attempt at creating a reusable board

## Features

- IEC C14 socket
- Dual fuse holder
- Power switch
- Voltage selection for US and EU voltages when using a dual primary transformer
- MOV for voltage surge suppression
- NTC thermistor for current inrush limiting

## Bill of Materials

- Schurter DC21 power inlet with power switch
- Schurter 4301.1405 fuse drawer
- V&K V80212MS02Q voltage selector switch
- Littelfuse V150LA2PX2855 Varistor
- EPCOS / TDK Inrush Current limiter\*

* You must select an adequate inrush limiter for your target application.
